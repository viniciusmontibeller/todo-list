## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project i deepen my knowledge in TypeScript as well as practice my SASS skills(first project with it). I learned that using SASS for theming is somewhat hard, but could find a good solution nonetheless. 

### Continued development

I will continue developing my TypeScript skills further as i think very highly of this leanguage and it's benefits, despite it's hight complexity. With this project i could see the power of SASS and will be learning and experimenting on it to build up my knowledge with this pre-processor.

## Acknowledgments

I got to say that i'm really happy to be studying with the lessons by [Dev em Dobro](https://github.com/devemdobro). I started with zero programing skills and now i can see that i'm growing little by little into what i wanted to be.
